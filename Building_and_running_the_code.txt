# To build the code using the included makefile:

# Module loads for the hip code on Dardel
ml PDC rocm/5.3.3 craype-accel-amd-gfx90a
make all

# Running the code
There are four bash scripts for running the benchmarks used in the report. They are

- run_seq.sh for the sequential version.
- run_omp.sh for the OMP version. Takes a command-line argument for the number of threads, e.g. bash run_omp.sh 16 for 16 OMP threads
- run_omp.sh for the MPI version. Takes a command-line argument for the number of processes, e.g. bash run_mpi.sh 16 for 16 OMP processes
- run_hip.sh for the HIP version.

All four requires allocating a (GPU) node using salloc

For running the code using more advanced inputs, see the included documentation
